# SpaceyBlast, A Bum-Rushed Prototype and GameJam Entry
Not an impressive project, by any means. The project is in a bit of disarray, as I only spent an hour or two a day for two weeks on this, with the goal of using primarily C++. Towards the end of that two weeks, I started to rely heavily on blueprints to make faster progress and push across the finish line. It was rushed and the design and structure reflects it. I also attempted to squeeze in android support. While functional, it's unoptimized and for mobile or performance on mobile.

This is a 10 wave, asteroids-esque shooter game.

## Features
- Floaty, asteroids-like ship movement
- Shooting, of course, using two different guns
- Shields
- Between-wave upgrades, with various upgrade options
- 5 Enemy ships with different stats and difficulty
   Basic enemies are more or less fleshed out in parenting/inheritence, so it would be fairly easy to create new enemy ships in just a few minutes
- Boss ship at wave 20

Feel free to use the code and assets, for any purpose. The assets are opensource as is the code. I'd reccomend a refactor of the code for any large project, however. This was very quickly cobbled together and the UI is a complete mess!
